# Step-by-Step Experimental Setup

## Step 1: Dataset Splitting & Similarity Measurement

### 1.1. Split the 30 datasets into two equal sets:

* Set A (Reference Set) → 15 datasets with their engineered filter pipelines.
* Set B (Evaluation Set) → 15 datasets that will be tested with pipelines from Set A.

## 1.2. Compute Similarity Between Datasets
For each dataset in Set A, compute its similarity with every dataset in Set B using:

* Feature-Based Similarity Metrics:
  * Histogram of gradient orientations (HOG) + Cosine Similarity.
  * Image contrast & texture statistics (e.g., standard deviation of pixel intensities).
  * Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) over a representative sample of images.

* Deep Feature Embeddings (optional):
  * Extract embeddings using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
  * Compute cosine similarity of feature vectors between datasets.

* Final Pairing:
  * Sort datasets in Set B for each dataset in Set A based on similarity score.
  * Select the most similar, medium similar, and least similar dataset for each pair.

This results in three groups of dataset pairs: High, Medium, and Low Similarity.

# Step 2: Apply Filter Pipelines Across Pairs

## 2.1. Apply Engineered Pipelines from Set A to Set B

* Each dataset in Set A has a pre-engineered filter pipeline.
* Apply that pipeline to its corresponding dataset in Set B.
* For each dataset in Set B, compute segmentation quality using MCC.

### 2.2. Compute Baseline MCC for Each Dataset in Set A

* Run the original engineered pipeline on its own dataset and record MCC.
* This provides a reference for how well the pipeline performed in its intended scenario.

### 2.3. Compute Cross-Applied MCC for Set B

* Apply pipelines from Set A to their assigned datasets in Set B.
* Measure the MCC score.

Now, we have:
* MCC (Baseline): Performance of the pipeline on its original dataset.
* MCC (Cross-Applied): Performance of the same pipeline on a new dataset.

## Step 3: Statistical Analysis & Significance Testing

### 3.1. Measure Performance Retention Across Pairs

Compute ΔMCC (Performance Drop):

```
Δ 𝑀C𝐶 = MCC_Baseline - MCC_Cross-Applied
```

Compute mean and variance of MCC differences across all pairs.

### 3.2. Compare MCC Performance Across Similarity Groups

* Perform an ANOVA test to check whether the performance drop (ΔMCC) is significantly different across the High, Medium, and Low Similarity Groups.
  * Null hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in MCC drop between different similarity levels.
  * If  `𝑝 < 0.05`, similarity level affects generalization.
* Conduct pairwise t-tests (with Bonferroni correction) to see if specific groups differ significantly.

### 3.3. Correlation Analysis Between Similarity and MCC Retention

* Compute the Pearson correlation between dataset similarity scores and MCC retention (ΔMCC).
* If correlation is strong and negative (e.g., r<−0.5), dataset similarity is a key predictor of MCC performance drop.

### 3.4. Robustness Check: Randomized Baseline Comparison

* Shuffle dataset pairings and re-run pipeline evaluation on randomly assigned datasets.
* Compare randomized MCC performance with similarity-based MCC performance.
* If similarity-based pairs perform significantly better than random, it validates the importance of dataset similarity.

### Step 4: Interpretation & Conclusion

#### Possible Outcomes & Their Meaning

| Finding | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| No significant difference in MCC drop across similarity groups (ANOVA 𝑝 > 0.05) | The engineered pipelines generalize well, and dataset similarity is not a key factor. |
| Significant difference (𝑝 < 0.05) but no strong correlation (𝑟 > −0.5) | Pipeline generalization is affected by dataset similarity, but other factors also play a role. |
| Low similarity pairs perform much worse than high similarity pairs | Pipelines are highly dataset-specific and require adaptation. |
| Randomized pairs perform as well as similarity-based pairs | The engineered pipelines do not transfer well, regardless of similarity. |
